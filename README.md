## Overview
NeXoCard is an AI-powered flashcard generator designed to help users study and retain information more effectively. Our platform allows users to generate flashcards by simply providing a prompt or uploading a PDF file. The generated flashcards contain questions on the front side with three options, and users can test their knowledge by selecting the correct answer. Additionally, NeXoCard offers a chatbot for asking questions, a memory game to enhance retention, and a leaderboard to track progress.

## Features
